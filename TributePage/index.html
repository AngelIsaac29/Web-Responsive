                        <p>Marie Curie was born Maria Skłodowska in Warsaw, Poland. She moved to Paris to pursue higher
                            education,
                            where she met Pierre Curie. The couple married in 1895 and collaborated closely in their
                            scientific
                            research. Tragically, in 1906, Pierre Curie died in an accident, leaving Marie to continue
                            their
                            work
                            while raising their two daughters, Irène and Ève. Despite the challenges, she remained
                            dedicated
                            to
                            her
                            research and made significant strides in the field of radioactivity. </p>

                        <p>Discovery of Polonium and Radium: In 1898, alongside her husband Pierre, Marie Curie
                            discovered
                            two
                            new
                            elements: polonium, named in honor of her native Poland, and radium. This groundbreaking
                            work
                            expanded
                            the periodic table and deepened the understanding of radioactive elements. </p>
                        <p>Isolation of Pure Radium: Marie Curie developed methods to isolate radium in its pure
                            metallic
                            state.
                            This achievement allowed for the detailed study of radium's properties, including its
                            potential
                            therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer treatment.</p>
                        <p>Establishment of the Radium Institute: Curie played a pivotal role in establishing the Radium
                            Institute
                            (now the Curie Institute) in Paris, which became a leading center for nuclear physics and
                            chemistry
                            research. The institute contributed significantly to scientific advancements, including the
                            discovery of
                            artificial radioactivity by her daughter Irène and son-in-law Frédéric Joliot-Curie.</p>

                        <p>Marie Curie passed away on July 4, 1934, from aplastic anemia, a condition linked to her
                            prolonged
                            exposure to high levels of radiation during her research. At the time, the harmful effects
                            of
                            ionizing
                            radiation were not well understood, and she often handled radioactive materials without
                            adequate
                            protection.</p>

                                <p>Nobel Prizes: Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the
                                    only

                                    have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. In 1903, she shared the
                                    Nobel
                                    Prize in
                                    Physics with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity. In
                                    1911,
                                    she
                                    received
                                    the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her services to chemistry through the discovery of
                                    radium
                                    and

                                <p>Advocacy and Education: Beyond her research, Curie was a dedicated educator and
                                    advocate
                                    for
                                    science. She became the first female professor at the University of Paris and was
                                    instrumental
                                    in promoting the use of radium in medicine. During World War I, she developed mobile
                                    radiography
                                    units, known as "Little Curies," to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.</p>
